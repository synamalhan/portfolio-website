# Syna Malhan ‚Äì Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website ‚Äì a curated showcase of the projects, designs, and experiments that represent who I am as a developer, designer, and problem solver.

## üåê What This Is

This is a responsive and interactive portfolio site built with **React**, designed to give visitors an engaging and intuitive experience. It's more than a resume ‚Äì it's a digital extension of my identity.

## ‚ú® How It Works

- **React (CRA)** for component-based UI development
- **Modular Components** ‚Äì reusable building blocks for layout, animation, and data
- **Responsive Design** ‚Äì optimized for mobile and desktop experiences
- **Custom Animations** ‚Äì floating elements and subtle transitions for interactivity
- **Deployed on GitHub Pages** ‚Äì easy to access and continuously updatable

All content is dynamically rendered using component props and state, allowing for easy updates without touching layout code.

## üí° Why This Exists

This site is my way of:

- üìå Centralizing everything I‚Äôve worked on, from machine learning models to UI/UX experiments  
- üé® Blending design with function to reflect both technical skill and creativity  
- üöÄ Giving recruiters, collaborators, and fellow developers an easy way to explore what I bring to the table

## üõ†Ô∏è Highlights

- **Project Cards** with staggered animations and hover effects
- **Mobile-specific Features** like custom fish animations and adaptive layouts
- **Clean and Maintainable Code** with a focus on scalability
- **Custom Assets & UI** ‚Äì including original SVGs and interactive elements
